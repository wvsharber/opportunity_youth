    "1. The total number and percentage of opportunity youth in S. King Co. lowered between 2014 and 2017. This trend is also repeated across all age groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Opportunity youth without college experience are more prevalent than those with college experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although our analyses are unable to discern between demographic effects and policy change effects, we are confident that opportunity youth numbers have lowered in S. King Co. We suggest that future service programs focus on helping opportunity youth transition from high school to college."
