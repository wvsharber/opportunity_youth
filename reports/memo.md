South King County is home to 92% of the counties high poverty schools. With little information on “opportunity youth” between the ages of 16 and 24 who are neither enrolled in school nor working, the Roadmap Project Initiative in collaboration with the Community Center for Education have collected and utilized data on this demographic in south King County. By collecting data on opportunity youth, educational inequalities may be pinpointed and addressed. The Roadmap Project Initiative works in a collaborative partnership with more than 200 entities to increase academic equality by 2020.
Here, we synthesize data from the 2017 5-year American Community Survey (ACS) Public Use Microdata Survey (PUMS) and compare the data with the last reported data from 2014. We summarize the data and highlight opportunities for advances in the program, especially considering potential demographic shifts that may suggest redirecting community service efforts. 

Our preliminary analyses show:
- An overall decrease in the youth population in south King Co.
- A decrease in the percentage of opportunity youth in the total youth population
- A large decrease in opportunity youth ages 22-24 
- An overall decrease in the highest educational achievement among opportunity youth:
- The percentage of opportunity youth with college experience decreased
- The percentage of opportunity youth with a high school diploma (or equivalent) or less increased

The data support a reduction of opportunity youth in south King Co., but do not indicate what has contributed to the reduction. Although the data provides insight to the numbers and percentages of opportunity youth compared to the total population, we are limited in our interpretative abilities by the following:
1. Lack of partner data detailing efforts and contributions leading to an overall decrease of opportunity youth, for example increased scholastic funding or increased employment within the targeted areas
2. Inadequate data on efforts being made to specific targeted age or racial demographics to attribute to any reduction in opportunity youth
3. There is no data on the movement of opportunity youth to areas outside of south King County

Exploring additional data such as job reports within the geographic and demographic area would allow us to consider other contributions to the decline in opportunity youth. We suggest acquiring and analyzing school data to research academic inequalities as per the aim of the Roadmap Initiative. Finally, reanalyzing the 2014 PUMS data with our methods would permit a more directly comparable assessment of the two time frames.
